I‚Äôve been interested in technology my whole life, from games to computers.
Sound, on the other hand, has grown into my obsession.

In my eight years of working in sound, I‚Äôve pursued the idea of the ‚ÄúPerfect Workflow.‚Äù I‚Äôve focused on spending the least time fumbling with file naming, export settings, asset tracking, and other manual work and maximizing my creative time with sound. 
I get excited when I realize a line of Python code will save me 2 minutes each time it runs.

I‚Äôve been able to continue sharing this excitement in the workplace: 
At Piranha Games, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to design and implement sounds for their most significant IP, MechWarrior. I‚Äôve also had a blast creating killer tools to automate workflows for my team and me. 
As a technical sound design contractor, I‚Äôve had the privilege of prototyping audio systems. Recently, I worked on a custom method for implementing diffraction and wrote tools to track used/unused files.

In 2023, I started Game Audio Tools, working on FilePal. FilePal is a filename management and asset tracker program that works with today‚Äôs game audio tech (Reaper, Wwise, Unreal).

There‚Äôs a lot more work to do. I‚Äôll keep my head down and ears open.  üôÇ
